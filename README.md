 # Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

# What Will you Learn?

In this project you will:
- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to your app experience.
- Leverage a third-party library in your app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
